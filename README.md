  nervecell.gif The Global fashion industry is valued at 3 Trillion Dollar &amp; Accounts for 2% of World's GDP. Here we are going to use ML technique to classify the Fashion Class to build a virtual stylish assistant that looks at customer's social media images &amp; classify what styles the customers are wearing, The virtual assistant can help retailer to find fashion trends &amp; launch targeted fashion campaigns. Here we are going to use fashion MNIST data which contains images of bags, shoes, dresses, etc. &amp; we are asking the deep network to classify the images into 10 classes.Here We want to build say app or model which can learn &amp; say what kind of class this image belongs to whether it is bag, shorts, dress, hat. That is we want to build a deep learning model that can classify the images into different categories.Here we have gray-scale images &amp; have to classify these gray-scale images into 10 class or 10 cathegories. The Prime example that we are going to build can be Amazon's Echo look style Assistant.
